## 👋 Hi there, I’m Cahaya Tambunan

🎯 I’m a Data Analyst Intern at PT Gunung Raja Paksi, where I build dashboards, optimize SQL queries, and collaborate across teams to support data-driven decisions.

📘 I transitioned from Mathematics Education to Data Science after graduating from a top-tier bootcamp and never looked back.

🛠️ I enjoy building smart, efficient solutions — especially when I get to automate processes, visualize insights, and turn messy data into meaningful stories.

💬 Always happy to connect, collaborate, or chat about data, tech, or career transitions!
